        <h2>1. Get Comfortable Before Nursing</h2>
        <p>Use pillows to support your back and arms. A nursing pillow under your baby can make a huge difference in comfort and positioning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>2. Try Different Nursing Positions</h2>
        <p>Experiment with cradle, football, and side-lying holds to see what works best for both you and baby—especially during nighttime feeds.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>3. Look for Feeding Cues</h2>
        <p>Watch for signs like rooting, sucking motions, or hands to mouth. Don’t wait for crying—it’s a late sign of hunger.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>4. Burp Mid-Feeding</h2>
        <p>Pause to burp your baby halfway through a feeding, especially if bottle-feeding. This helps release trapped air and reduce spit-ups.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>5. Use Gentle Pats for Burping</h2>
        <p>Pat gently on the back while baby rests on your shoulder or sits in your lap with chin supported. Every baby prefers something slightly different.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>6. Keep Baby Upright After Feeding</h2>
        <p>Hold your baby upright for 15–20 minutes after feeding to help with digestion and reduce reflux.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>7. Watch for a Good Latch</h2>
        <p>A good latch should feel like a tug, not a pinch. Baby’s mouth should cover most of the areola, not just the nipple.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>8. Stay Hydrated & Nourished</h2>
        <p>Keep a water bottle and snacks nearby during nursing sessions. Your body needs fuel to make milk and recover.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>9. Track Feedings if Helpful</h2>
        <p>Use a notebook or baby tracking app to log feeding times and which side you last used. This can help during those sleepy early days.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip">
        <h2>10. Give Yourself Grace</h2>
        <p>Every mom and baby are different. If things don’t go perfectly, you’re still doing a great job. Reach out for help when needed.</p>
