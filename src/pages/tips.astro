        1. Get Comfortable Before Nursing
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Use pillows to support your back and arms. A nursing pillow under your
        baby can make a huge difference in comfort and positioning.
      </p>
    </div>

        2. Try Different Nursing Positions
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Experiment with cradle, football, and side-lying holds to see what works
        best for both you and baby—especially during nighttime feeds.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        3. Look for Feeding Cues
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Watch for signs like rooting, sucking motions, or hands to mouth. Don’t
        wait for crying—it’s a late sign of hunger.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        4. Burp Mid-Feeding
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Pause to burp your baby halfway through a feeding, especially if
        bottle-feeding. This helps release trapped air and reduce spit-ups.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div
      class="tip bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 transform transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-lg"
    >
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        5. Use Gentle Pats for Burping
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Pat gently on the back while baby rests on your shoulder or sits in your
        lap with chin supported. Every baby prefers something slightly
        different.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        6. Keep Baby Upright After Feeding
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Hold your baby upright for 15–20 minutes after feeding to help with
        digestion and reduce reflux.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div
      class="tip bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 transform transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-lg"
    >
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        7. Watch for a Good Latch
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        A good latch should feel like a tug, not a pinch. Baby’s mouth should
        cover most of the areola, not just the nipple.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div
      class="tip bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 transform transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-lg"
    >
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        8. Stay Hydrated & Nourished
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Keep a water bottle and snacks nearby during nursing sessions. Your body
        needs fuel to make milk and recover.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div
      class="tip bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 transform transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-lg"
    >
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        9. Track Feedings if Helpful
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Use a notebook or baby tracking app to log feeding times and which side
        you last used. This can help during those sleepy early days.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div
      class="tip bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 transform transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-lg"

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">
        10. Give Yourself Grace
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Every mom and baby are different. If things don’t go perfectly, you’re
        still doing a great job. Reach out for help when needed.
