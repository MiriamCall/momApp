    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      Welcome to Mommy Time, your dedicated companion through the beautiful and
      often challenging journey of motherhood. We understand that being a mom is
      a full-time job, and sometimes you just need a little extra support, a
      quick tip, or a moment of calm.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      Our mission is to provide practical tools and comforting resources to help
      you navigate newborn feeding, track important milestones, and find moments
      of peace in your busy day. From nursing timers and feeding records to
      daily tips, soothing music, helpful videos, and recommended reads, we're
      here to make your mommy time a little easier and more joyful.
